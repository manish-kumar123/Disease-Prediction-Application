# Disease-Prediction-Application

1. Developed a disease prediction application using Python programming language and various libraries including NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn.
2. Utilized Scikit-learn library to implement logistic regression model for disease prediction based on patient data.
3. Employed Pandas library to load and manipulate data from CSV file ('patient_data.csv'), extracting features such as age and blood pressure, and the target variable 'Disease'.
4. Implemented data preprocessing techniques such as imputation of missing values using SimpleImputer from Scikit-learn.
5. Constructed a pipeline with SimpleImputer and logistic regression model using make_pipeline from Scikit-learn.
6. Split the data into training and testing sets using train_test_split function from Scikit-learn.
7. Utilized tkinter library to develop a graphical user interface (GUI) for the disease prediction application.
8. Designed a user-friendly interface with labels and entry fields for inputting patient's age and blood pressure.
9. Implemented a prediction function to predict disease status based on user input, displaying the result using messagebox from tkinter library.
10. Demonstrated proficiency in Python programming, data manipulation, machine learning, and GUI development.
